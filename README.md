current features
================
main program
------------
  - responds generically to DMs and emoji reacts
  - generically handles 48-hour pings
  - Apart from the DM, react, and 48h triggers, no meaningful behavior is
    handled here.  This way, we can start with a barebones system and add
	"phases" as we increase the functionality of the bot.

drafting phase
--------------
  - the current author or an admin set the current author
  - rcp drafting
  - rcp draft locking to prevent multiple players drafting the same rcp
  - sending a final RCP message
